<head> <title> Reflection </title> </head>
<body>

<p> By the time I'm making this, the 1st quarter exams are done. Now, I think, is the right time to finally look back at the 1st quarter and reflect on my mistakes, best moments, and things I can improve on. I will enumerate each error, improvement, and best moment so that it's easier to read. </p>

<h1> Best moments </h1>

<ol>
<li> Orientation </li>
<p> Tbh my day didn't start well since we had to go to school early because we had flag cem. But once I saw my friends I immediately smiled, and we even hugged each other. Orientation was the same day as Dewi's birthday, so afterward me, Arkin, Dewi, Ross, Cai, and Pia G. went to Southmall to celebrate Dewi's birthday. </p>

<li> All the volleyball practices </li>
<p> We had a lot of ball practice, but this one was the best. So Eli's group in vball wanted to practice. We decided on practicing in Marcellius court but someone already reserved. Then, Sean Jordan (from Fidelity) said that we could join their practice at GLSK. But that was booked too. Since our groupmates had already told their parents about the practice we just settled for BFRV park. Unfortunately, Caleb accidentally hit a car and the owner reported us. We were surprised when two police officers told us to stop playing. We needed to practice. Luckily, Santi is a homeowner in PHILAM, so we got to practice at the soccer field there. Fyi, we were also joined by some other Fidelity students. After practice, we went to a restaurant. We started talking, and that was when I got close with Eli, Caleb, Santi, and Zaph. We were in Alipapa (the name of the restaurant) until 7 pm. And Caleb's mom offered to take us to dinner! In short, we ate Shakey's; then Caleb's mom dropped us off one by one since it started raining. </p>

<li> Interactions with ******* </li>
<p> I can't tell you how much I love eye contact. It's my love language. </p>
</ol>

<li> Watching social media instead of sleeping early </li>
<li> Going home late, and then complaining how I can't finish my tasks on time </li>
