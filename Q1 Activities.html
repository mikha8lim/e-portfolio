So basically, August was filled with groupworks and events. I was the representative of my class for the declamation contest held during the Buwan ng Wika celebration. I didn't enjoy the foundation day since I had to leave early. My band "IV of a Kind" also had the chance to play during the foundation day, but then again, I was subbed by someone else cause' I had other plans to attend to. We also had a four-day suspension of classes. September, meanwhile, was all about volleyball. Volleyball helped me build new friends. Lastly, by the time that I'm doing this, it is cuurently the 2nd day of the exam, so I better study. Okay bye!
